## How to run the program:
When the application is first installed, the user needs to create a profile with the required information in the profile page. Then the user can go to the home page and select a meal which will send the user to the meal selection page. In the meal selection page, the user can search for the desired food and select the meal by clicking on it. When the selection is done, the user can click on the distribution button to go to the distribution page. In this page, the user should input the amount of every previously added food to see the total carbohydrate amount of all the meals.  After clicking on the instant info button in this page, the user will be sent to the instant information page. In this page, the user should input some necessary information to calculate the insulin amount needed and when to inject it. After the information is ensured, the user will press to the calculate button, which will take the user to the calculation page. In this page, the user can see the amount of insulin that needs to be injected and when. There also is a change favourites page, which allows the user to add meals to favourites or delete meals from favourites. The user can then see these changes in the show favourites page. We also created an add food page for the user to add a meal that is not on the food list, by giving the essential information about the food, the user can easily add a new food to the food list.
